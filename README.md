This is build using the create-next-app and tailwind css.

This app is createed while learnig next.js.

I learned from [code With harry React.js](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu0W_9lII9agx66oZnT6IyhcMIbUMNMdt), [Code with harry next.js](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu0W_9lII9agtWvR_TZdb_r0dNI8-lDwG)

## These scripts refer to the different stages of developing an application:

- `dev` - Runs `next dev` which starts Next.js in development mode at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- `build` - Runs `next build` which builds the application for production usage
- `start` - Runs `next start` which starts a Next.js production server
- `lint` - Runs `next lint` which sets up Next.js' built-in ESLint configuration
